# NATURAL RESOURCES
Natural resources are **materials and substances that occur naturally in the environment** and are essential for the survival and well-being of living organisms, including humans. 

They can be categorized into renewable and non-renewable resources based on their availability and ability to replenish over time.

# PROBLEMS ASSOCIATED WITH NATURAL RESOURCES EXPLOITATION

## Resource Depletion
Overuse of non-renewable resources leads to scarcity.
## Ecosystem Disruption
Extraction harms biodiversity and ecosystems.
## Water Scarcity
Excessive freshwater use results in shortages.
## Deforestation
Land clearing disrupts ecosystems and cycles.
## Soil Erosion
Poor practices degrade agricultural land.
## Pollution
Resource extraction causes air and water pollution.
## Climate Change
Fossil fuels contribute to global warming.
## Conflict
Resource competition can lead to conflicts.
## Social Inequity
Benefits unevenly distributed in communities.
## Waste Generation
Extraction generates significant waste.
## Resource Mismanagement
Inefficient use and corruption.
## Loss of Culture
Threatens indigenous heritage.
## Ocean Pollution
Overfishing and marine ecosystem harm.
## Energy Dependency
Vulnerability to supply disruptions.
## Invasive Species
New species disrupt local ecosystems.
## Global Inequity
Resource exploitation worsens global inequalities.
