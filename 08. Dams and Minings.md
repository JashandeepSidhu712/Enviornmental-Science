# Environmental Effects of Dams:

## Habitat Alteration: Dams flood large areas, altering natural habitats and potentially displacing plant and animal species.

## Water Quality: Reservoirs behind dams can accumulate pollutants and sediments, impacting water quality downstream.

## Altered Hydrology: Dams change river flow patterns, affecting ecosystems and aquatic life downstream.

## Erosion: Reduced sediment flow downstream can lead to erosion and loss of delta ecosystems.

## Fish Migration: Dams can obstruct fish migration, harming fish populations and aquatic food chains.

## Altered Thermal Regimes: Dams can change water temperature, impacting aquatic organisms.

## Methane Emissions: Decomposing vegetation in reservoirs can produce methane, a potent greenhouse gas.

# Environmental Effects of Mining:

Habitat Destruction: Mining often clears forests and disrupts ecosystems, leading to habitat loss.

Soil and Water Pollution: Mining activities can release pollutants into soil and water, harming local ecosystems and human health.

Deforestation: Access roads and clearing for mining can result in deforestation.

Biodiversity Loss: Habitat disruption can lead to the decline or loss of plant and animal species.

Air Pollution: Dust and emissions from mining machinery can contribute to air pollution.

Water Depletion: Mining operations may require large amounts of water, impacting local water sources.

Acid Mine Drainage: Chemical reactions in exposed rocks can produce acidic runoff, harming aquatic life.
